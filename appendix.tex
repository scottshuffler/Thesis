\chapter{Some technical lemmas}
Here are some technical lemmas that are put into this appendix
so as not to disturb the flow of the exposition.

Notice that the 
\texttt{$\backslash$appendix}
command just causes the output of the 
\texttt{$\backslash$chapter} command to appear as ``Appendix A''
instead of, say, ``Chapter 7''.

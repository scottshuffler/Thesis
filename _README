These files were created by Richard Belshoff in March 2001
for use by graduate students at SMS intending to write a thesis
in LaTeX.   

You should have the following twelve files:

README                 - This file
abstract.tex           - the abstract
acceptance.tex         - the acceptance page
acknowledgements.tex   - the acknowledgements page
appendix.tex           - a sample appendix (optional)
body.tex               - a sample of the main body of the thesis (REQUIRED!)
copyright.tex          - the copyright page (optional)
dbfile.bib             - a sample database file for use with bibtex
elliptic.eps           - a sample figure in encapsulated postscript
preamble.tex           - a sample preamble file; change it as you wish
thesis.tex             - the main file which produces the thesis
titlepage.tex          - the title page.

I have followed the guidelines in the document 
"GUIDE TO THE PREPARATION OF A THESIS" dated September 1996,
from the SMS Graduate College. According to that document, the 
thesis will contain the following components in the order given.  

1.  Title Page                - titlepage.tex
2.  Copyright notice (if any) - copyright.tex
3.  Abstract                  - abstract.tex
4.  Acceptance Page           - acceptance.tex
5.  Acknowledgements          - acknowledgements.tex
6.  Table of Contents         - automatically generated by LaTeX
7.  List  of Tables (if any)  - automatically generated by LaTeX
8.  List  of Figures (if any) - automatically generated by LaTeX
9.  Body of Thesis            - YOU NEED TO WRITE THIS (a sample is included)
10. Bibliography              - uses bibtex.  Read the bibtex documentation!
11. Appendix (if any)         - done with the LaTeX \appendix command
12. Index (if any)            - Suggestion: use the makeindex package

The following packages are required:
geometry       - for setting the margins and page size correctly
setspace       - for doublespacing

These packages are optional:
graphicx (for graphics), amsmath, amsfonts, latexsym, amsthm.

All of these packages are available on the math server.

You will need to run bibtex to generate the bibliography.

If you really need or want an index, read the documentation for the
makeindex package.

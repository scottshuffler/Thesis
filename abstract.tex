Honeybees are an important part of our everyday lives. Many foods we eat on a daily basis are dependent on some form of pollination. These foods include nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables. In recent years, the population of honeybees has been declining due to a phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder. Research on this disorder is still lacking and there is still much to learn. As part of this thesis, a management system will be developed that would manage the data acquisition systems installed at a honeybee hive. The acquisition system records data at the hive. The management system will allow the setting of parameters on various data acquisition components. The system also provides analysis options that the hive owners can use to monitor and determine the health of their bees. This basic hive data will include audio and temperature from inside the hive, as well as video of the beehive entrance.}
